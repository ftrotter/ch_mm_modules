Acute Asthma in Children Aged >2 Years																							
																							
 - Consider intensive inpatient treatment for children with SpO2 <92% on air after initial bronchodilator treatment.																							
																							
 - The use of structured care protocols detailing bronchodilator usage, clinical assessment, and specific criteria for safe discharge is recommended.																							
																							
 - Inhaled beta2 agonists are the first line treatment for acute asthma. (Schuh et al., 1989; Schuh et al., 1990; Robertson et al., 1985; Schuh et al., 1999)																							
																							
 - pMDI + spacer are the preferred option in mild to moderate asthma.																							
																							
 - Individualise drug dosing according to severity and adjust according to the patient's response.																							
																							
 - The early addition of a bolus dose of intravenous salbutamol (15 micrograms/kg) can be an effective adjunct to treatment in severe cases.																							
																							
 - Give prednisolone early in the treatment of acute asthma attacks.																							
																							
 - If symptoms are refractory to initial beta2 agonist treatment, add ipratropium bromide (250 micrograms/dose mixed with the nebulised beta2 agonist solution).																							
																							
 - Aminophylline is not recommended in children with mild to moderate acute asthma.																							
																							
 - Consider aminophylline in a High Dependency Unit or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting for children with severe or life threatening bronchospasm unresponsive to maximal doses of bronchodilators and steroid tablets.																							
																							
Acute Asthma in Children Aged <2 Years																							
																							
 - Oral beta2 agonists are not recommended for acute asthma in infants.																							
																							
 - For mild to moderate acute asthma, a pMDI + spacer is the optimal drug delivery device.																							
																							
 - Consider steroid tablets in infants early in the management of moderate to severe episodes of acute asthma in the hospital setting.																							
																							
 - Consider inhaled ipratropium bromide in combination with an inhaled beta2 agonist for more severe symptoms.
