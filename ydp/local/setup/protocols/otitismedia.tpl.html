{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="followup" type="text" size="50"

Children under three years of age with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion and hearing loss of <25 dB, but no speech and language, 
development or behavioural problems, can be safely managed with watchful waiting. If watchful waiting is being considered, 
the child should undergo audiometry to exclude a more serious degree of hearing loss.

Children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion who are over three years of age or who have speech language, 
developmental or behavioural problems should be referred to an otolaryngologist.
