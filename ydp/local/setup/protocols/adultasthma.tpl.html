3. What are the Treatment Goals for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="treatment_goals" type="text" size="50"

4. What are the typical Medications for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="medications" type="text" size="50" 
value="Distinguish maintenance medications from rescue medications.  Document dosage accurately.  Carefully document frequency of rescue medication use.
Inquire about medications for allergies (antihistamines, nasal steroids) and GERD (proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, antacides). Inquire about beta blockers.
Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: The main types of anti-inflammatory drugs are corticosteroids (inhaled and oral), mast cell stabilizers, and the leukotriene modifier drugs;
Inhaled steroids: Advair (a combination medication that includes a corticosteroid plus a long acting bronchodilator drug), Aerobid,
Azmacort, Flovent, Pulmicort, Qvar;
Mast Cell Stabilizers: Intal (also is effective for exercise induced asthma when taken 30 minutes before activity), Tilade;
Leukotriene modifier drugs: Accolate, Singulair, Zyflo;
Beta 2-agonists -- Short-acting inhaled forms include: Albuterol (Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, Accuneb), Alupent, 
Combivent (combines a beta 2-agonist and an anticholinergic),Duoneb (combines a beta 2-agonist and an anticholinergic),Maxair, Xopenex;
Long-acting forms of beta 2-agonists include: Advair (combines a beta 2-agonist and anti-inflammatory drug), Serevent, Foradil; 
Theophylline is another type of bronchodilator that is used to control asthma. Sold under the brand names Uniphyl, Theo-Dur, Slo-Bid, and Theo-24

5. Indications for lab studies for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="lab_studies" type="text" size="50" 
value="Objectively document the presence of asthma via:  spirometry with bronchodilators or methacholine challenge. Repeat baseline spirometry at least annually.
Monitor response to triggers and therapy via serial peak expiratory flow measurements (recorded in a diary or otherwise).

6. Indications for imaging studies for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="imaging_studies" type="text" size="50" 
value="N/A
"}<br>

7. Outcome goals for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="followup" type="text" size="50"
value="Key indicators:
.Percentage of patients who were identified as having persistent asthma during the previous year who were prescribed asthma medications during the measurement year
.Percentage of all individuals with mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma who were prescribed either the preferred long-term control medication (inhaled corticosteroids) or acceptable alternative treatment

YDP additional standards:
.Patient understanding of disease, satisfaction with care
.Percentage goals met per risk factor adjusted diagnosis
.Percentage of patients weight weighed and counselled on weight, exercise

"}<br>

8. Referral criteria, if referring patient out for Adult Asthma?<br>
{input style="width: 6in; height: 1in;" name="followup" type="text" size="50"
value="Lack of improvement in key indicators despite stepped-care addition of asthma medications, implementation of environmental controls and/or educational measures. Presence of co-morbid conditions:  chronic cardiovascular disease, especially.
