Creating A new Map: (Developer interest only)

When starting from scratch you need to make a fields file using field_maker.php. This will loop over a directory with MedMan data in it and create a file with autogenerated field names, based on the longest line found in that file. 

Then you can intelligently name the fields with descriptive names in these generated field files, which should live under the fields/ directory.

Then run map_maker.php which will create a map class from the field description in the field_file.  

This will auto name the fields of a file based on the largest line in that data file
